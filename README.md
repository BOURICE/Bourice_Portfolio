## Professional Statement

Aspiring SOC Analyst with foundational training in Linux, networking, and network security. Passionate about defensive security, monitoring, and threat detection, I am Currently building practical skills through labs, CTFs, and security projects.

My prior experience in IT systems, SQL data analysis, and structured reporting enhances my ability to analyze patterns, interpret data, and maintain organized documentation, essential qualities in security operations. I am committed to continuous learning and real-world application of cybersecurity principles.
My goal is to specialize in Security Operations (SOC), focusing on monitoring, detection, and incident response.

Here is a collection of hands-on cybersecurity exercises and lab-based projects documenting my practical learning journey.
